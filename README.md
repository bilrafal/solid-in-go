# SOLID-IN-GO

## SOLID
1. Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
2. Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
3. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
4. Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
5. Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A type should have one primary responsibility => it should have only one reason to change

Separation of concerns:
different concerns or different problems that the system solves have to reside in different constructs, 
whether attached to different structures or residing in different packages.

### Open-Closed Principle (OCP)
* Open for extension, closed for modification. 
* Closely related to <u>Specification (Enterprise pattern)</u>.


### Liskov-Substitution-Principle (LSP)
* if an API works with the base class it should also work with the derived class
